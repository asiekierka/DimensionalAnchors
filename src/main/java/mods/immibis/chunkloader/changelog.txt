* Fixed error and "data lost; report this bug" on startup. Sorry!

57.1.91:
* Fixed worlds not being loaded on startup.

57.1.9:
* Remembered to disable debug spam.

57.1.8:
* Fixed more problems with Applied Energistics, Thermal Expansion, probably others.
* Hopefully this fixed the root cause of all the problems.

57.1.7:
* Possibly fixed "NullPointerException in LinkedHashMap.create" when exiting dimensions (could not reproduce here).

* Opped players can set chunk loaders bigger than 9x9.
* The GUI will not stop you setting a chunk loader bigger than you are allowed, but if you do, it will not load chunks.
* Chunk loaders that are deactivated for another reason (quota or onlineness) will not use fuel.
* Significant internal changes - report any bugs.
  Existing chunk loaders might need to be broken and replaced.
 

57.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.6.4.

54.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.1.
* Testing something new - might have obfuscation problems.

53.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.
* New bug: F9 overlay is broken - need a Forge change or a coremod to fix.

52.2.0:
* F9 overlay changes:
  - The blue border is always shown around your current chunk, even if it's not force-loaded.
  - The blue border around your current chunk is lighter now.
  - Chunks which are force-loaded by other mods will have a yellow square above them, instead of red.
  - Chunks which are force-loaded by both DA and another mod will have an orange square above them.
  - Chunks with multiple chunk loaders force-loading them will not be highlighted in darker red - this was a side effect of internal changes.
  - Server-owned chunk loaders are highlighted yellowish-green.
* Added shapes. Currently you can use a square (previously the only option) or a line in either axis.
* Added a display of the amount of fuel left, if fuel is turned on, in the chunk loader GUI.

  these worlds at startup.

  It should no longer be necessary, and should save a small amount of CPU.

* Per-player overrides added to config. In immibis.cfg, section chunkloader.playerQuotaOverride,
  add entries of the form: '<username (lowercase)>=<number of chunks they can have loaded>'
  or '<username (lowercase)>=unlimited' (without the <> or '')
  This overrides everything else including ops having unlimited quota.

50.0.0pr2:
* Untested (!) update to 1.3.2 chunk loading.

  dimension number on Bukkit.
